## A single tourism page for people visiting California using Google Maps & Places API as well as OpenWeather API

### UX

I created this website as a tribute to the current visit Modesto website that has seen better days. I made it so users who would be visiting the area would have the information they needed and nothing else.

**User Story 1:**
John Doe is in the area and wants to know the current weather. He can do so by scrolling past the main image to view the weather widget.

**User Story 2:**
Jane Doe wants to know what events are going on in Modesto. She can do this by clicking the events button in the navigation bar and the webpage will immediately go to the events section.

**User Story 3:**
Jeff Doe wants to look for a nice place to eat. He can do so by clicking on the map button in the navigation bar and the webpage will immediately go to the google maps section.

**User Story 4:**
Jerry Doe wants to view photos from the annual Graffiti Night of years past. He can do so by clicking on photos in the navigation bar and the webpage will immediately go to the photos section.

**User Story 5:**
Jeff Doe wants to read more about Modesto and its culture. He can do so by clicking on the about button and the webpage will immediately go to the about section.

**User Story 6:**
Jeff Doe is done using google maps and wants to go back to the top of the page. He can do so by clicking the home button in the navigation bar and the webpage will immediately go to the top of the page.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**

- **CSS**

- **Bootstrap**  - The project uses bootstrap for the navbar, events, and image carousel.

- **jQuery**  - The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

- **Google Fonts**  - The project uses Google fonts in order to use the Roboto Font.

- **Font Awesome**  - The project uses Font Awesome in order to display various icons for social media and the hamburger menu in mobile view.

- **Google Maps** - The project uses the google maps API to display a map of the local area and a search bar with auto complete.

- **Open Weather** - The project uses open weather API to display the local weather.

### Testing

I tested this out the old fashion way. One page at a time using a visual studio extension called  [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). This extension lets you view a page as it would be displayed online.

This site was tested across various browsers and browser sizes. Multiple times I used  [W3 validator](https://validator.w3.org/)  to debug and remove extra tags in my code. Using the contact page with an invalid email address you will get an message to correct it. Using a correct email and submitting will simply reset the form.

### Deployment

This website was deployed through Github Pages directly from the master branch. In order to run the code locally simply download the files, start up Visual Studio Code or your IDE of choice to check it out. The difference between the development version and deployment version are little to none.
